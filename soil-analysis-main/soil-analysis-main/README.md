# Soil Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing soil samples to determine their nutritional content, identify deficiencies, and recommend suitable crops for the analyzed soil. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts optimize their yields by providing actionable insights based on the soil's condition.

## Features
- **Nutritional Content Analysis**: Identifies the levels of key nutrients in the soil.
- **Soil Quality Assessment**: Indicates whether the soil is suitable for planting or requires improvement.
- **Deficiency Detection**: Highlights nutrients that are lacking and provides suggestions to improve soil quality.
- **Crop Recommendations**: Suggests the best crops to grow based on the soil's condition.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train the machine learning model.
- **Google Colab**: For collaborative model development and training.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset includes soil sample features such as pH level, nitrogen content, phosphorus content, potassium content, and organic matter. Labels for crop suitability and nutritional sufficiency are also provided.

## Model
- A neural network with:
  - Input layer: Processes soil sample features.
  - Hidden layers: Includes dense layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
  - Output layer: Predicts nutritional status and crop recommendations.
- Regularization techniques such as **Dropout** are used to prevent overfitting.
- The model is optimized using the **Adam optimizer** and uses **mean squared error (MSE)** as the loss function.

## Setup Instructions
